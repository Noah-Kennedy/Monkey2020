\subsubsection{Changes to Previous Verification Plan}\label{subsubsec:changes-to-plan}
\subsubsection{Testing Suite}\label{subsubsec:testing-suite}
Table 3 below covers what software functions and components of the Nav were verified, how they were verified, and
whether each one passed.
Localization estimates are left untested until integration with the Visual Processing Software Subsystem since they
require both subsystems to work together.

        \hline
        Name & Objectives & Definition & Results \\
        A* & Correctness - Is the algorithm implemented in a sound manner? & Unit tests & Pass \\
        Nav & Safety - Does it avoid steep (>20Â° incline) slopes? Adherence to the supplied parameters - Start and end position and orientation, minimum turn radius Length - Does it take a reasonable path, not looping or backtracking? & Unit tests & Pass \\
        Mesh to Grid & Faithfulness - Does the grid representation closely match the physical terrain? & Human-reviewed & Fail; needs more refinement
