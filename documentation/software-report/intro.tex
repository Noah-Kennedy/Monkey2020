\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{subsec:problem-statement}
The NASA RMC Lunabotics team is in need of a modular autonomous control system for their competition robot.
To meet the competition requirements, the automation system must be able to navigate from a staging area of the
competition field to a digging area and back while avoiding obstacles and without human input.

\subsection{Purpose of this Document}\label{subsec:purpose}
This report will cover the verification of our software subsystems.
A separate report has been constructed which covers the hardware aspects.
We have broken this report down by subsystem.
For each subsystem, we will provide a brief description of the system under test,
an outline and plan for the tests which were run,
and the results of those tests.
