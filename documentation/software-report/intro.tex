All jokes from the abstract aside, this is our verification report and test plan for the
verification approaches used in our demos.
This report will cover the software aspects only, as a separate report has already been constructed
which covers the hardware aspects.
We have broken this report down by subsystem.
For each subsystem, we will provide an overview of the system under test and the test which was
run, as well as the results of those tests.
