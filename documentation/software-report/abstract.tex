Digital monkeys are a recently discovered species of monkey who have recently become the
subject of significant academic study due to their significant potential for use in
extraterrestrial mining operations.
Digital monkeys, like biological monkeys, can be taught to perform many advanced tasks and are
capable of complex problem solving.
In particular, they seem to exhibit advanced pathfinding and visual cognition capabilities, as well
as a sophisticated communications protocol.
Unfortunately, few researchers have previously seen fit to study the mental capacities of digital
monkeys.
In this paper, we outline the mental capacities of digital monkeys across three cognitive ares:
pathfinding, visual cognition, and communication.
