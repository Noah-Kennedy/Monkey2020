    This whitepaper, written by Edward Olson of the University of Michigan EECS department,
    outlines the AprilTag system of fiducial markers for computer vision applications.
    The article talks in-depth about the math involved in AprilTag detection, as well as the
    structure of an AprilTag marker.
    This article is relevant to the project because the M.O.N.K.E.Y. needs to implement some form
    of visual fiducial detection to aid in locating important landmarks in the field, and AprilTag
    is a robust fiducial system suited for such a task.
